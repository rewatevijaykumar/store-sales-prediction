# Big Mart Store Sales Prediction

## Problem Statement

Nowadays, shopping malls and Big Marts keep track of individual item sales data in 
order to forecast future client demand and adjust inventory management. In a data 
warehouse, these data stores hold a significant amount of consumer information and 
particular item details. By mining the data store from the data warehouse, more 
anomalies and common patterns can be discovered.

## Approach: 

The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, 
Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine 
learning algorithms thatâ€™s best fit for the above case.

## Results: 

You have to build a solution that should able to predict the sales of the 
different stores of Big Mart according to the provided dataset.

# Tech Stack Used

1. Python
2. FastAPI
3. Machine Learning Algorithm
4. Docker
5. MongoDB


## Dataset:

We have train (8523) and test (5681) data set, train data set has both input and output variable(s). We need to predict the sales for test data set.

- Item_Identifier: Unique product ID
- Item_Weight: Weight of product
- Item_Fat_Content: Whether the product is low fat or not
- Item_Visibility: The % of total display area of all products in a store allocated to the particular product
- Item_Type: The category to which the product belongs
- Item_MRP: Maximum Retail Price (list price) of the product
- Outlet_Identifier: Unique store ID
- Outlet_Establishment_Year: The year in which store was established
- Outlet_Size: The size of the store in terms of ground area covered
- Outlet_Location_Type: The type of city in which the store is located
- Outlet_Type: Whether the outlet is just a grocery store or some sort of supermarket
- Item_Outlet_Sales: Sales of the product in the particulat store. This is the outcome variable to be predicted

## Deploy using docker

### 1. Build ->
`
docker -t <docker-image-name> . 
`
### 2. Check docker images ->
`
docker images
`
### 3. Run docker image ->
`
docker run -p <host-port>:<container-port> <docker-image>
`
